Meeting notes from sprint 1 retro:

- If your name is on the ticket your in charge of making sure it gets done.
  - You will need to talk to and coordinate with the other people on the ticket.
  - you will need to make sure it gets merged
  - you will need to make sure it gets demoed

- We kind of put things off till the last minute.

- Reduce points we are expecting to do.

- Disparity between functional output and new learning. Sometimes new features require time to learn the technology.

- We only have about 1 day a week to work on the project.

- We need to only work on High Priority REQUIRED features since we have limited time.
